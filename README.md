# Fabled Engine
Self Study on developing a game engine. Learning as I go.
</br> Not done the core parts of the rendering. 
</br>
Creating core render crate. Currently the engine uses my old implementation which i need to clean and improve alot. 
</br>

## Rendering Changes will be pushed to render branch till it is verified that the whole render crate works with the core engine and is integrated with the core engine.
</br>
Any issues, enchancement, features, or bugs report are always welcome in Issues.
