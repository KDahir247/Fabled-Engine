# Fabled Engine

## Currently Broken. Re-Working solution with knowledge I've aquired so far.

Working on strengthening my understanding in assembly. It seem like it vital for game engineer.
I will bounce between Fabled Engine and assembly study and eventually learn cpu design (can't help it I really enjoy the nitty gritty).

[Assembly Study](https://github.com/KDahir247/X86AssemblyPratice/ "Fabled Assembly Study")

CPU design will be posted on my github when I start learning it. All these studies will be used to complement this Game Engine.
This is going to be a Big project which I don't see myself finishing in a really long while and I will be working on it daily either through
studies reading or writing code (Game engine architecture, cpu design, or assembly).

# Changes.
 - pushing to main now it seem to be really un-organized when creating seperate branches for each component in the engine. They will be a branch for experimental feature and other that make sense.

Any issues, enhancement, features, or bugs report are always welcome in Issues.

Going to change my development pipeline. I will use GitHub for public changes, while also using JetBrain source for interal team/self project management and
forward detail GitHub.
