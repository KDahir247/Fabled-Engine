split audio clip by specifying the start duration and end duration and add mixer capability to it such as
looping through the sliced audio.

I don't want to create alot of sink at the benefit of allowing each clip to adjust their own volume
as it is expensive to create alot of sink rather than just having on sink that has a mixer append to it
to represent the spatial position audio.

We can also create a single sink which will hold a mixer for all the standard audio.
If we look at unity audio system the default audio source will play on top of other audio sources in (spatial set to 2d).
It doesn't play in sequence. If the user want to play the audio clip after the other audio is finished.
They can specify the delay for the audio clip to wait before playing.
