// split audio clip by specifying the start duration and end duration and add mixer capability to it such as
// looping through the sliced audio.




// We don't want to create multiple sink for playing audio in the same position (same output) since this
// is excessive and redundant operation. What we will do is create one sink and one mixer the sink will append
// the mixer and the mixer composer will play the audio.

// Note that to play audio in sequence we will need to add a delay to the next audio in sequence and so on.
