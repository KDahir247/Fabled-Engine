Handle case where the user switch from different output devices. Currently when the user switch from desktop to headphone it would
still play from the desktop and vis versa. I got to create a way were i get a call-back or notification and play the audio from the
from correct output devices.

add is_playing to raw_clip, raw_ambisonic_clip, audio_clip
add loopable to raw_clip, raw_ambisonic_clip, audio_clip
add pan to raw_clip, raw_ambisonic_clip, audio_clip
switch audio volume to take in volume as db
camera listener will have a affine3d when it is implemented.
OutputSource and ambisonicOutput source will set the spatial sink orientation
on the affine3d of the camera listener.
added a decibel file for audio that will convert db to linear and other helpers.
remove self and be explicit eg. -> Self to -> StructName
remove rayon.
