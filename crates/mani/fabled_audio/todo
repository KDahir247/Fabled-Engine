Handle case where the user switch from different output devices. Currently when the user switch from desktop to headphone it would
still play from the desktop and vis versa. I got to create a way were i get a call-back or notification and play the audio from the
from correct the output devices.

Maybe implement Input Config and allow sound recording for flac, ogg, wav, mp3
If I allow Input, Output

add ConfigInput to allow user to record audio

Nice to make audio transformation extendable where it will allow user to create the own transform for the audio clip.
This will be as a feature not a core.

Rather than letting rodio handle loading in the audio format I want to be explicit on loading each audio format.

ogg ogg crate and lewton crate
flac claxon crate
wav hound crate
mp3 minimp3 crate

Got to create a system that
will allow the user to record as long as possible without blocking on a separate
thread and stop it and save it to the given format

Rodio spawns a background thread that is dedicated to reading from the
sources and sending the output to the device and I want user to have control
over customizing the audio clip data I will wrap it in a Mutex. Might have
to create a separate thread for audio since I dont want Mutex to block the
main thread which will handle core logic for read when write is happening,
but a dedicated thread.

Mutex will be faster if you mostly only ever have one reader at a time.
There will only be on reader for this type since it is moved to a raw_clip
type. and from there it is moved to an audio output and played.
writing can still happen after reading though so we will lock this if it is
reading or writing and treat reader and writer the same and lock on either
case. Mutex also support more 3rd tier support and prevent writer starvation.

Clean up directory in the audio folders. Follow fabled_render folder structure.

remove decodes file (flac, mpeg, vorbis), but keep waveform file.
decoding is only used for input audio and not converting audio format.
