Handle case where the user switch from different output devices. Currently when the user switch from desktop to headphone it would
still play from the desktop and vis versa. I got to create a way were i get a call-back or notification and play the audio from the
from correct the output devices.

Nice to make audio transformation extendable where it will allow user to create the own transform for the audio clip.
This will be as a feature not a core.

Clean up directory in the audio folders. Follow fabled_render folder structure.

Recording audio "WavWriter" will use concurrency when Fabled_Concurrency is complete.
