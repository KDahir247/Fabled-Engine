Handle case where the user switch from different output devices. Currently when the user switch from desktop to headphone it would
still play from the desktop and vis versa. I got to create a way were i get a call-back or notification and play the audio from the
from correct the output devices.

Clean up directory in the audio folders. Follow fabled_render folder structure.
