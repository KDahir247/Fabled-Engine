Handle case where the user switch from different output devices. Currently when the user switch from desktop to headphone it would
still play from the desktop and vis versa. I got to create a way were i get a call-back or notification and play the audio from the
from correct the output devices.

Maybe implement Input Config and allow sound recording for flac, ogg, wav, mp3
If I allow Input, Output

add ConfigInput to allow user to record audio

Nice to make audio transformation extendable where it will allow user to create the own transform for the audio clip.
This will be as a feature not a core.

Got to create a system that
will allow the user to record as long as possible without blocking on a separate
thread and stop it and save it to the given format

Clean up directory in the audio folders. Follow fabled_render folder structure.
