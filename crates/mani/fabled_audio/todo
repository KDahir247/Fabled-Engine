add a way to adjust the volume for each clip.
We can't append to the sink because the mixer is already appended to the sink and
the mixer doesn't get complete until it is dropped, thus it will also drop the sink
so the mixer will play until both the mixer and sink have dropped.

I don't want to create alot of sink at the benefit of allowing each clip to adjust their own volume
as it is expensive to create alot of sink rather than just having on sink that has a mixer append to it
to represent the spatial position audio.

Eg. Fire crackling and cricket chirping in the space spatial position.
