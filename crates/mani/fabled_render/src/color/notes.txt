Personal notes.

The color grading will be using ACES. ACES has four different type of space we will be using (excluding ACESProxy).
Color grading will be done using the ACEScc or ACEScct depending on preference. ACEScct and ACEScc both use log space,
so we will not need to have a function that will convert a color from linear space to log space and from log space to linear.

Note that for color grading we will need to convert ACES2025 and/or ACEScg to ACEScc or ACEScct depending on preference.

Watching da vinci color tutorial it look like it does contrast in log space.


srgb to ACES-2025 -> ACES2025 to log (cc or cct) -> cdl (color decision list) -> contrast -> log (cc or cct) to ACES2025

for cdl refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC_CDL

formula = output = (i x s + o) ^ p

where i is the input pixel
      s is the slope
      o is the offset
      p is the power
