List of some distance falloff function
1) Inverse Square attenuation function
2) Exponential Attenuation function
3) Smoothing Attenuation function


control the punctual light intensity either with luminous power units
or luminous intensity units for the photometric profile

Directional light will be controlled by Illuminance

The luminous power is always
converted into luminous intensity for lighting calculations

The luminous power can be calculated from
luminous intensity by integrating the luminous intensity over the light solid angle
