// Calculating the Light intensity for a Point light
// Luminous Intensity is using candela for it's measurement which is equalivent to lumen per steradian
Luminous Intensity (Intensity) = Luminous Flux  / 4 * PI


// Illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area.
// Illuminance is using lux for it's measuremenet.
// Spherical surface radius is equalivent to the radius of the point light.
Illuminance = luminous Flux / 4 * PI * spherical surface radius * spherical surface radius


// The physically correct illuminance at the distance.
// Where D is the distance from each point on a surface being shaded from the light position.
D = ||light position - point position||
Illuminance D = Luminous Intensity (Intensity) / D * D
Which can be re-written as
Illuminance D = (Luminous Flux / 4 * PI) / ||light position - point position|| * ||light position - point position||
Illuminance D = (Luminous Flux / 4 * PI) / distance falloff function (D)
