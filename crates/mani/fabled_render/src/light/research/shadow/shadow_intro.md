the point p lies in shadow if and only if there exists a light sample l such as that p doesn't
see the l. meaning that the whole light source is blocked by the geometry. p shadow is said to be in umbra.
if only some light sample are not seen p shadow is in the penumbra. Otherwise, if p see l then it is lit.
