Research about lighting for game engine.


Luminous Flux is the total amout of visual power emitted by a light source.

// Calculating the Light intensity for a Point light
// Luminous Intensity is using candela for it's measurement which is equalivent to lumen per steradian
Luminous Intensity (Intensity) = Luminous Flux  / 4 * PI


// Illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area.
// Illuminance is using lux for it's measuremenet.
// Spherical surface radius is equalivent to the radius of the point light.
Illuminance = luminous Flux / 4 * PI * spherical surface radius * spherical surface radius


// The physically correct illuminance at the distance.
// Where D is the distance from each point on a surface being shaded from the light position.
D = ||light position - point position||
Illuminance D = Luminous Intensity (Intensity) / D * D
Which can be re-written as
Illuminance D = (Luminous Flux / 4 * PI) / ||light position - point position|| * ||light position - point position||
Illuminance D = (Luminous Flux / 4 * PI) / distance falloff function (D)

List of some distance falloff function
1) Inverse Square attenuation function
2) Exponential Attenuation function
3) Smoothing Attenuation function


Calculate the light attenuation in the fragment shader.
We can then get the illuminance from the.

punctual lights,
1) Directional light,
2) Spot Light
3) Point Light,

photometric lights,
1) IES profile,
2) EULUMDAT profile

area lights,

control the punctual light intensity either with luminous power units
or luminous intensity units for the photometric profile

Directional light will be controlled by Illuminance

The luminous power is always
converted into luminous intensity for lighting calculations

The luminous power can be calculated from
luminous intensity by integrating the luminous intensity over the light solid angle
