// Use POD
// Get the vertex, tangent, bi-tangent
// If the bi-tangent or tangent is missing calculate the tangent and bi-normal
// Instancing support???
// Indices U16(Vec<u16>) and U32(Vec<u32>)
// Model should a collection of vertex data, option of Indices.
// The module should have support for primitive shapes, such as capsule, cube, sphere, cylinder, maybe cone, plane, maybe torus, quad, maybe geosphere, maybe teapot
