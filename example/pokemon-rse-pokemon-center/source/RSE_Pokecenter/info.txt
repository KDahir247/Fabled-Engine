Maybe my last Pokemon remake! Bringing RSE's Pokecenter to life!
This model has a 3D pixel art style trying to remain as close to the original sprites as possible.

Anyone is free to use this model for any non-monetary use due to Nintendo's Copyrights.

The sound file included in the package is a MIDI file that I got from:
